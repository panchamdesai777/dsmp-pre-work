### Project Overview

 In this project which is titled as **SPY GAMES** I have deciphered several messages that i had recieved from the various sources into simple plain text using various python operation.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I had a better understanding of solving logical problems using python. In this project, I had applied the following concepts:

String operations
Conditional statement and loops
File I/O
Functions


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Following are the steps I took while approaching the problem :
 
1. Message Reading
The first thing I had to do is to write a function that reads the contents of the files that we have.

2. Message Fusion
In this task,I had to make use of messages of two different files. In the two files, we have one number each. I had to apply a certain operation to extract our message.

 3. Message Substitution
In this task, I had to substitute the message of the file for a secret message.

4.MessageComparision
In this task, I had to make use of messages from two different files. I had to compare the two messages and take only those words that appear in first message but not in second message.

5. Message Filter
In this task, I had to extract only those words from the message in the file that are of even length.

6. Message Writing
I had successfully deciphered all the message bits that I had received. In this final task, I had combined all the message bits into a single message and write it in a file.


### Challenges faced

 A lot of times i faced error of syntax or indentation error which i overcomed by going again and  again through the code and perfecting the syntax.
