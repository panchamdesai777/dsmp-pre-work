### Project Overview

     This project is generally a **Student Management  System**  it will generally help us to check the progress of students in each subject  and also find out who has performed the best in a particular subject and who has performed worst in any particular subject.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project,  I had learned how to solve basic python problems . In this project i had applied the following concepts:
1. - Mathematical operations
2. - List operations
3. - Dictionary operations
4. - String indexing and formatting



### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The following approach  I had used while working on this project 
1 . created a new register by combining data from two classes while making some modifications to the register.
2. created a dictionary for a student in each subject to generate his progress report. 
3. Then I had checked  who performed best in mathematics from all the students  who appeared for the test.
4. Finally printed the name of topper in mathematics subject
